/*-------
Makes targets pop up at the user's command. Targets go down after being hit,
and return back with user action. Because swivel targets have a different
script assigned to them that works differently from all other targets, 
they are handled separately in the script. If you don't plan
to use swivel targets at all, feel free to delete the corresponding part
of the code.
